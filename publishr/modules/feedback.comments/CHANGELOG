2010-09-12 # 1.4

[NEW] The `feedback:comments:form` markup is finally using forms from the 'feedback.forms' module.

[NEW] Adds a widget with the latest comments to the dashboard.

[NEW] Using the features of the new FObject class, the 'feedback.comments' module adds the
'comments' and 'comments_count' getters to instances of the `system_nodes_WdActiveRecord` class.

[NEW] The 'author_ip' property is used to store the IP of the author.

[NEW] The status of new comments is now configurable and editable.

[NEW] There is now a configurable required delay between comments posting.  

[CHG] Renamed the `node` parameter of the `feedback:comments:form` markup to `select`. The
parameter is now an expression and default to `this`.

[FIX] The author of a comment receives a notification even if the author replies to himself.





2010-03-30 # 1.2

[FIX] The _reponse_ notify process was setting the `notify` property to `0` instead of "no", once
the notification was sent, which was causing endless resending of the notify since I was looking
for `!= "no"`.

The query in now looking for `(notify = "yes" || notify = "author")`.

An exception is thrown if one tries to set the property to anything else then "no", "yes" or
"author".
