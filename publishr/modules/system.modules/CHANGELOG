[NEW] There is now two views to manage "actives" and "inactives" modules. 

[FIX] Newly added modules were activated by default because we were disabling modules using a
list of modules to disable. We are now using a list of enabled modules, modules missing from the
list are now disabled, except for mandatory modules.
