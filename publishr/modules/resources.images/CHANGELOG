[NEW] Redesigned Operation API.




2010-08-30 # 1.3

[NEW] The 'alt' property can now be used to set the alternate text for the image.

[NEW] The module can now associate an image to configurable instances of the 'system.nodes' module.
The id of the associated image is stored in the metas of the object. The `image` getter is added to
instances of the `system_nodes_WdActiveRecord` class.

[DEL] Because the 'thumbnail' method and the 'thumbnail' virtual property are now added to our
active records using the new features of the WdComponent class, they have been removed from the
resources.images active record.




2009-12-24 # 1.2

[NEW] The thumbnail() method can be used to get a thumbnail version of the image. Be default, the
'primary' version if used.

TODO: 'primary' should be constructor dependend.
