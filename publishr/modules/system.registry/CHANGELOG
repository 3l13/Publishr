2011-02-21 # 2.2-dev

[NEW] The module adds the virtual property `registry` to the Core object, but instead of a module
object (as for the deprecated global variable `registry`), the `registry` property is a model
object. The `registry` global variable was holding a module object in order to differ the database
connection, but we don't need that anymore thanks to the FObject class getters. All the code has
been moved from the module to the model.

[NEW] All of the metas pairs can be retrieved from the metas handler using the `to_a()` method:

	$metas = $core->user->metas->to_a();




2010-11-15 # 2.1

[NEW] The module add metadatas support for the "system.nodes", "user.users" and "site.sites"
modules.
