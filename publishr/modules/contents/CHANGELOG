renamed them as 'home_include' and 'home_exclude'.

[NEW] A multi-editor is now used to edit contents. The user can now choose between an RTE,
Textmark, raw and more...

[NEW] The rendered contents is now cached in the metas of the object, if it's different than the
source content. 

[CHG] An RTE is now used to edit the excerpt. Both the contents and the excerpt produce HTML,
making things a lot easier to handle. The new wd_excerpt() function does a better job too at
creating excerpt from contents.

module. Other module, such as 'contents.articles' override the 'date' element to edit the time
too.
