2011-04-10 # 1.0-dev

[NEW] Redesigned Operation API.

[CHG] Options are now JSON encoded and saved in a single row. Previous configs are still supported.




2010-10-31 # 1.2.0-dev

[NEW] The 'thumbnail' method and the 'thumbnail' virtual property are now added to instances of the
'resources_images_WdActiveRecord' class by using the features of the new WdComponent class.

[NEW] The `thumbnail` operation is added to the "resources.images" module, with the following pattern:
`/api/resources.images/<nid:\d+>/thumbnail`. Only the node identifier of the image is needed by this
operation, the path of the image is retrieved using file matching, there is no database access.

[NEW] Parameters to create the thumbnail can now be passed to the `thumbnail` method instead of
the version name. Parameters must be provided as CSS style properties e.g. "w:100;h=200"

[NEW] Under some strange and unknown circumstances, IE6 uses URL with encoded entities. We now try
to rescue the bullied URIs.

[NEW] Added parameters shortends.

[CHG] Renamed WdThumbnailerConfigElement class as WdAdjustThumbnailElement.

[CHG] The '.cleanup' file is used as a marker for the last cleanup date. The registry is no longer
used to store the next cleanup date.

[FIX] The 'no-upscale' property is not always handled correctly.




2010-06-07 # 1.1.5

Miscellaneous improvements.




2010-04-20 # 1.1.4

[NEW] Added support for transparent backgrounds, allowing PNG images to be resized while preserving
their transparency. By default, `background` is now 'transparent', unless the `format` is 'jpeg',
in which case the `background` is 'white'. 




2010-02-16 # 1.1.2

[CHG] Changed default resizing method to 'fit' instead of 'scale-min', following the update of the
WdImage class.




2010-01-08 # 1.1.0

[NEW] Modules can use a 'thumbnailer' config to define their thumbnail versions. If the `module`
key is defined the config block of the module is extended in order to configure the tumbnail
versions defined.

[NEW] The cleanup of the repository is now periodical (15 minutes period).

[NEW] Added the 'Expire' information to the thumbnail header. 

[FIX] The installation failed to create the repository.




2009-11-26 # 1.0.6

[NEW] The `interlace` option can now be used to generate interlaced images.

[CHG] Renamed the `no-stretch` option as `no-upscale`.

[CHG] Because JSON packing is no longer supported by the registry, a small update has been made to
the `getVersion()` method.




2009-09-24 # 1.0.4

[NEW] The image data is now sent by the module itself it does no longer rely on the HTTP
'Location:' directive. A HTTP header suitable for data caching is sent along the data.

[NEW] The `no-stretch` option can now be used to disable image stretching, which happen when
the thumbnail dimensions are bigger than the actual image ones. The `surface` method is used
to choose whether or not the image can be resized.
