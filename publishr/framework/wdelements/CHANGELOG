2010-12-14 # 1.8-dev

[NEW] T_OPTIONS_DISABLED is now implemented for the E_CHECKBOX_GROUP and E_RADIO_GROUP types too.

[NEW] Using the WdElement::walk() method, the WdElement::get_named_elements() method can
recursively retrive the named elements of a elements.

[NEW] Using the cascading translation scope feature of the new WdI18n class.

[NEW] The 'cache assets' core config option can be used to enable assets caching by the
WdDocument class.

[NEW] The WdFormSectionElement::T_PANEL_CLASS can be used to add classes to the _panel_ element. 




2010-11-08 # 1.6

[NEW] The WdDateRangeElement can be used to create date range picker elements.

[NEW] The T_WEIGHT tag can now be used to define a relative target for the element to be inserted
`after` or `before` e.g. `T_WEIGHT => 'target:before'`.

[NEW] Assets of a document object can now be merged and cached, resulting in
a unique CSS file and a unique JS file. Cached assets are referenced in a
Javascript array for information.

[NEW] Added support for custom attributes, using the HTML5 "dataset" feature.

[CHG] Changed the 'left', 'right' and 'top' label positions to 'before', 'after' and 'above'.

[CHG] Renamed the T_MANDATORY tag as T_REQUIRED, to match the HTML5 attribute.

[CHG] Supports MooTools 1.3.

[FIX] WdFormSectionElement produces empty form labels when the element is required but
the WdForm::T_LABEL is empty.

[FIX] WdFormSelectionElement: children are now ordered according to their weight.

[FIX] WdElement: checkbox of checkbox groups are cheched when their value is `false`.




2010-07-08 # 1.4

[NEW] The WdDocument class can be used to create HTML documents. Currently, its main purpose is to
handle the stylesheets and scripts that are added to the document while it gets generated.

The class comes from the WdPublisher it was rewritten for a better and more efficient handling of
assets :

	$document->js->add('public/edit.js'); // add to script
	$document->css->add('public/edit.css'); // add to script

Assets URLs are resolved against the server document's root to compute an URL relative to the base
of the site.

[CHG] WIP: the validate() method is no longer a callback caller, its now an active thing...  

[CHG] The key of the options defined using the T_OPTION tag for the E_CHECKBOX_GROUP element type
is no longer used as the value of the checkbox option but only has the name of the option. For
example a 'test => "One"' for a "field" checkbox group will no longer produce a
'name="field[test]" value="test"' but rather 'name="field[test"]'. Thus, standard booleans are now
defined when a checkbox is checked rather than the key of that checkbox.  

[CHG] Session is now handled trought the application `session` property.




2010-03-29 # 1.2

[CHG] WdElement: renamed the `getTag()` and `setTag()` methods to `get()` and `set()`.




2010-03-11 # 1.0

[NEW] WdElement: The `disabled`, `name` and `value` attributes are now discarted when stringifying
elements for non input type elements. This makes it easier for us to use these attributes for
custom elements type made of several input elements.

[NEW] WdForm: The `isElementMissing()` method can be used to know if an element was missing when
the form was validated.

[CHG] Wd2CForm: Only object elements are wrapped in a 'div.form-element' block.

[FIX] Values defined using the T_VALUES tag were not set if empty.
