Maybe `wdp:variable` has too much purpose since it's used to create a variable in the context
and modify existing ones. I should maybe create a `wdp:set` markup...

The 'select' attribute bothers me too because it's sometimes used with variables and some
other times with regular text. Maybe we could use `select="variable"` and `select=":some text"`, or
the other way around, e.g. for variables: `@` for `this` variables, `$` for global variables and
`:` for context variables... I'd rather use `:` for an _as is_ select.
