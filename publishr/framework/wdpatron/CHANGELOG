2010-11-08 # 1.1.10

[NEW] Added the 'replace' expression function, because the order of the parameters for the
str_replace function is wrong.

[NEW] The `feed` markup now transform the relative URLs in the feed to absolute URLs.

[NEW] Uses the has_property() method when available.

[NEW] A new syntax is available for Textmark to embed flash: [embed:](URL). The following sites
are supported : dailymotion, vimeo, youtube, soundcloud.

[CHG] WdHTTPException exceptions are rethrown when catched during parsing.

[CHG] All expressions are now escaped, even translations, unless the equal sign "=" is used at the
end of the expression e.g. "#{@contents=}". The bang sign "!" is no longer supported to escape
expressions and will issue an error.

[FIX] WdTextHole: objects implementing ArrayAccess are not correctly handled while evaluating
expressions.




2010-07-08 # 1.1.8

[NEW] Added 'capitalize', 'downcase', 'upcase', 'first' and 'bit' expression functions.

[NEW] The $_SERVER global array is extended, making `#{$server.http.host}` possible, which, in the
context, looks nicer than `#{$server.HTTP_HOST}`. This also apply to 'REMOTE' and 'REQUEST'.

[NEW] The `get_file()` method returns the file currently parsed.

[NEW] The `with-param` markup can now be used with every markup to provide complex parameters
values.

[NEW] Added the `wdp:document:css` and `wdp:document:js` markups to support the WdDocument class.

[CHG] Use the features of the new WdHook class.

[CHG] Rewrote the `wdp:feed` markup.

[DEL] Removed the `wdp:feed:date` markup.




2010-04-25 # 1.1.6

[NEW] The 'expression' hook parameter option replaces 'evaluate'

[NEW] The text replacement syntax has been extended to support a simplier way to escape special
characters. Using a trailling bang "!" after an expression escapes the special characters of its
evaluation. This only works with expression evaluations, not translations.

[CHG] 'no-binding' is now a hook tag rather then a hook parameter.

[CHG] The 'option' parameter of the WdTextHole::evaluate() method has been replaced with the
'silent' boolean parameter. 

[DEL] Since contents renders itself now, the textmark() and textmarkStrict() expression functions
where removed.




2010-03-25 # 1.1.4

The patron.elements, patron.feed and patron.native modules have been replaced by some lines in
the "core" and "hook" config files of the WdPatron software.




2010-02-01 # 1.1.2

[NEW] The text replacement syntax has been extended to support quick and easy translation of
strings e.g. `#{t:Hello world !}`. The `t:` is used to indicate that the string following should be
translated instead of evaluated.
 
[CHG] Renamed the getInstance() method as getSingleton(), which is more appropriate.




2009-12-24 # 1.1.0

[CHG] 'bind' is now an argument of the publish() method rather then an option.




2009-09-09 # 1.0.0

The WdPatron is made from the WdPublisher class without the 'publisher' features. The class
focuses on templates where WdPublisher focuses on URI handling.
