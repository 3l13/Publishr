[NEW] The WdAttachedFilesElement class can be used to create elements to manage files attached to
nodes.

[NEW] The `attached_files` getter is adding to instances of the `system_nodes_WdActiveRecord` class
using the new features of the FObject class.

[NEW] Attached images are created using the "resources.files" module.

[DEL] Removed the FancyUpload code.

[FIX] Sometimes the temporary name generated by PHP for uploaded files is the same, resulting in
uploaded files overwriting each other.
