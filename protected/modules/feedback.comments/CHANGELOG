[FIX] The _reponse_ notify process was setting the `notify` property to `0` instead of "no", once
the notification was sent, which was causing endless resending of the notify since I was looking
for `!= "no"`.

The query in now looking for `(notify = "yes" || notify = "author")`.

An exception is thrown if one tries to set the property to anything else then "no", "yes" or
"author".
