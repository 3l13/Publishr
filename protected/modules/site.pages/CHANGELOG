[NEW] the sites_pages::loadAllNested() method can be used to load nested nodes.


[CHG] sites_pages::loadAll() returns an array instead of a statement.

[CHG] Renamed the `level` virtual property of the Page active record to `depth`. 

TODO: if `urlVariables` are defined, the URL should be composed using them.

[CHG] Renamed `url_vars`, `url_local` and `url_local_vars` as `urlVariables`, `localUrl`
and `localUrlVariables`.

[DEL] Removed `url_local_vars`, since `url_vars` is even better.

[CHG] The URL is no longer computed during the find() method. Since the parents are already loaded
defering the URL composition to the Page active object seams the better solution.

[FIX] URL variables where not propagated if the page didn't have a pattern.




2010-03-30 # 0.6

[NEW] The extension of the template used for the page is now used to generate URL. The extension is
appended to the generated URL if the page has no child.

[CHG] The entire filename (as in "with its extension") of the template is now saved, making the
retrieving of the extension much easier. 




2010-02-17 # 0.4

[NEW] The `site.pages.url.change` event is triggered when a page's URL is changed during the
save operation.

TODO: Trigger the event during the updateTree operation too. 




2010-02-01 # 0.3

[DEL] The _bind_ feature, which was used to bind a content to a file is deprecated. The _views_
editor has replaced it. They didn't serve the same purpose, but the bind feature was used in that
way anyway.
 



2009-11-12 # 0.2

[CHG] The 'match' and 'captured' variables available in the page object when the page is retrieved
using the find() method have been renamed to 'url_local' and 'url_vars'.

[NEW] Two new properties are available in the page object retrieved using the find() method, namely
`url` and `url_local_vars`. The `url` property contains the whole URL to the page, and the
`url_local_vars` property contains the variables extracted using the pattern of the page.
