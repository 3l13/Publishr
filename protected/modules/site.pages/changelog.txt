[DEL] The _bind_ feature, which was used to bind a content to a file is deprecated. The _views_

[CHG] The 'match' and 'captured' variables available in the page object when the page is retrieved
using the find() method have been renamed to 'url_local' and 'url_vars'.

[NEW] Two new properties are available in the page object retrieved using the find() method, namely
`url` and `url_local_vars`. The `url` property contains the whole URL to the page, and the
`url_local_vars` property contains the variables extracted using the pattern of the page.
